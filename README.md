# nitroxoline_2024
Source data and analysis required for results and figures presented in the manuscript "Uncovering nitroxoline activity spectrum, mode of action and resistance across Gram-negative bacteria" https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.04.597298v1.

-  `2DTPP` contains two-dimensional thermal proteome profiling data and analysis
-  `GO_enrichment` contains the analysis needed to perform Gene Ontology enrichments on hits from 2D-TPP, chemical genetics and proteomics experiments.
-  `chemgen` contains chemical genetic data analysis.
- `figures` contains source data and code to generate figures and the code to calculate Bliss interaction scores from the combinatorial screen data (Fig. 2a). This also contains additional_figures.pdf which consist of a few supplementary figures (e.g. distinct replicates of checkerboard assays, raw growth curves of E. coli lptD mutant experiments, proteomics of nitroxoline-sensitive strains) removed from the final submission where Extended Data Figures and Supplementary Figures had to be combined in one Supplementary File.
